Disposition Instructions:

Guidance:
Determining record value - Consideration should be given to determining the record value of materials such as working papers drafts and notes which document an activity up to the point in time when those materials are created. Until a subsequent activity occurs which causes them to become superseded or obsolete the materials could warrant record status and be appropriate for preservation. Designating materials as nonrecords in anticipation of their being superseded or obsolete rather than at the point when they are actually superseded or obsolete can be premature in some instances. When it is difficult to decide whether certain materials are records or nonrecords they should be treated as records.
Records collected from abandoned sites (e.g. bankrupt companies abandoned offices) by EPA as part of site investigations or other activities that are not necessary for the conduct of Agency business and which have no informational value will be considered nonrecords. If regulated entities submit material either accidentally or intentionally that is not necessary for the conduct of Agency business it will also be considered nonrecord material.
Access restrictions - Nonrecord materials should not contain any security classified or administratively controlled information.
Removal of nonrecords from the Agency - Nonrecord materials should not be removed from the Agency except with the Agencys approval.
Short-term documentary materials - Nonrecords along with personal papers and short-term records comprise a broad category of materials that are not needed as part of the long-term documentation of Agency activities. Personal Papers are covered by EPA 0999. Examples of short-term records include transitory files such as suspense files and mailing list source records covered by schedule 1006 item d.
Convenience copies of records should be destroyed when the records are destroyed or sooner if no longer needed for reference purposes.
Schedule change history - A number of program-specific reference files formerly listed individually have been incorporated into this general Agency-wide item. See Previous NARA Disposal Authority below for a list of superseded schedules. This schedule incorporates and replaces EPA 0733 - News Clippings. Copies of news clippings which have documentary or evidential value may be incorporated into other records series (e.g. Superfund site files) and are to be disposed of in accordance with the disposition instructions for the related series.
Reasons for Disposition:
The following change was made in the 07312015 version:
 Added information about copies of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives to the Description.
The following change was made in the 02282014 version:

Nonrecord materials are identified in 44 U.S.C. Section 3301 and 36 CFR Section 1220.14. NARA guidance says: Nonrecord materials should be destroyed when no longer needed for reference. NARA determined copies of news clippings are nonrecord materials as part of N1-412-96-2.
