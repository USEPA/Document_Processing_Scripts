EPA Records Schedule 0744
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Beach Advisory and Closing On-line Notification (BEACON)
Program: Water
Applicability: Agency-wide with exceptions
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-09-18
Description:
The Beach Advisory and Closing On-line Notification (BEACON) is an electronic system that receives and displays nonrecord copies of state beach water quality and swimming advisory data. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 requires EPA to collect store and maintain a public right-to-know pollution occurrence database on state designated coastal recreation waters. These record copies are stored in the Program Tracking Advisories Water Quality Standards and Nutrients (PRAWN) database.
State agencies send beach data via EPAs Central Data Exchange (CDX). Input for the system flows through the Electronic Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (eBeaches) system and includes: (1) monitoring and station location information from the Water Quality Exchange (WQX) and STORET (2) notification data flows from the Program tracking Beach Advisory Water quality standard and Nutrient database (PRAWN) and (3) beach location data from the Reach Address Database (RAD). BEACON was formerly known as the National Health Beach Survey (NHBS).
Excludes: STORET (including WQX) scheduled as EPA 400 Reach (including RAD) which is the responsibility of the United States Geological Survey and PRAWN which is scheduled separately.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
