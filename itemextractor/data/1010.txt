Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Electronic travel system - This schedule covers the records in the electronic travel system. The electronic software program is a nonrecord and covered by schedule 0008 item a. The software documentation and electronic signature and verification data are covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Travel receipts - If original receipts are scanned into the electronic travel system the originals are considered convenience copies and are destroyed when no longer needed unless the scanned version is illegible. If the scanned version is illegible the original receipt(s) must be kept for the approved retention period. If the receipts are not scanned into the electronic travel system the original receipts need to be maintained for the approved retention period to validate claims. If the original receipts are maintained as paper it is recommended that they be maintained by a designated custodian in each organization and a copy of the travel voucher be printed and attached to the receipts or the travel voucher number written on the receipts so they can be easily matched back to the electronic transaction. Employees leaving the Agency must ensure the program office that funded the trip has their receipts if the records have not been scanned into the electronic travel system. Original receipts for Superfund site-specific travel are scanned into the Superfund Cost Organization Recovery Package Imaging Online System (SCORPIOS) (schedule 0052) and filed in the appropriate site file and retained with cost recovery records and covered by schedule 1036 item c.
Annual reports related to passports - Annual reports related to passports previously item b of schedule 0393 (GRS 95b) has been deleted because EPA does not submit annual reports. Passport registers previously item c of schedule 0393 is covered by schedule 0090 item b.
International travel reports - Item a of this schedule covers international trip reports maintained by the Office of International and Tribal Affairs. International travel reports maintained by other offices are filed with the related records and retained according to the disposition instructions for the related records.
