Description:
The Emergency Management Portal (EMP) serves as a gateway to various emergency preparedness prevention and emergency response applications. Currently EMP is the portal to five applications listed below.
Field Readiness (FR) provides a single source for all training records and serves as the central source for skill and expertise tracking for emergency response personnel (Response Support Corps (RSC)) across the Agency.
Equipment Tracking (ETM) allows the emergency response community to track the location status and maintenance of all equipment and parts and supplies within emergency response warehouses using standardized vocabularies such as model names and status terms.
Oil Database (Oil DB) serves as a central nationally-consistent platform for the Agencys Oil Spill Pollution Prevention Program tracking and measurement reporting. It enables users to search for and add facilities generate reports and store critical information such as inspection data discharge history and compliance data. The EMP Oil Application serves as the official database for the program.
Sampling-Monitoring and Analysis (SMA) is used only during incidents of national significance to collate regional sampling and monitoring information present it to the office subject matter expert for review and make it available for public dissemination.
The Local Government Reimbursement (LGR) database is used to manage local government applications for grants. It is a database of documents and notes from reviewers and allows generation of final payment documents and letters.
The system also contains an administrative module (EMP-Admin) which functions as the administration module for various applications and the Emergency Management Business Intelligence (EMBI) tool which allows for both standardized and ad hoc reporting of the data from several of the EMP applications.
