EPA Records Schedule 0329
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Pesticide Registration Information System (PRISM)
Program: Pesticides
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-09-16
Description:
The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has migrated all of its major data systems including regulatory and scientific data workflow tracking and electronic document management into one integrated system the Pesticide Registration Information System (PRISM). PRISM provides a centralized source of information on all registered pesticide products including chemical composition toxicity name and address of registrant brand names registration actions and related data. It consolidates information stored on the mainframe the OPP LAN on stand-alone computers and in paper copy. The purpose of this system is to decrease the data entry burden increase analytical capabilities better track decision-making processes prevent loss of and improve access to critical decision documents and make OPP information readily available to those both within and outside of the Program.
PRISM is the successor to the Office of Pesticide Programs Information System Network (OPPIN). Data has been migrated from the following databases: Chemical Vocabulary (CV) Company Name and Address (CNAD) Pesticide Document Management System (PDMS) Pesticide Product Information System (PPIS) Chemical Review Management System (CRMS) FIFRA CBI Access (FAS) Jackets Product Data Call-In (PDCI) Phones Pesticide Regulatory Action Tracking (PRAT) Reference System (REFS) Tolerance Indexes (TIS and TOTS). Sources of the input are paper copy and electronic data. EPAs Central Data Exchange (CDX) scheduled as EPA 097 is the gateway for electronic submissions.
The system is designed mainly for use by OPP staff however read-only access to the non-confidential business information (CBI) portion of the data is available to the entire Agency. Non-CBI information is available to the public.

However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
