Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Congressional correspondence - Significant congressional correspondence entered into the controlled correspondence system is covered by schedule 1051 item a for senior officials. If significant congressional correspondence is maintained separately from the controlled correspondence system use item a of this schedule for significant correspondence and item c for routine correspondence. Significant congressional correspondence is major correspondence that significantly documents program activities and may be processed under special handling control procedures because of the importance of the letters or time requirements of replies. Records related to the operation of CMS are covered by schedule 0077.
Legislative history file - Enrolled bill reports submitted by the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs are transferred to the legislative history file (item a) at the end of each month. EPA congressional hearing testimony maintained by the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs is transferred to the legislative history file (item a) after presentation to the congressional committee.
Copies of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives - The copy of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives (previously scheduled as schedule 0155a(3) 0527a(3) and 0528a(3)) maintained by the submitting office until they are notified by NARA that the transfer is successful is a nonrecord (schedule 0008 item a) and can be deleted when no longer needed.
