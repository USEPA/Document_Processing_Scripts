Description:
The FIFRATSCA Tracking System (FTTS) is a regional system used to track compliance activities such as inspections case review enforcement actions taken samples collected and pesticide grants and cooperative agreement information. The compliance monitoring and enforcement activities are tracked from the time an inspector conducts (or schedules) an inspection until the time the case is closed or the enforcement action is settled. The system provides for four categories of reports: (1) reporting and enforcement and compliance assurance priorities (RECAP) (2) standard reports (3) ad hoc reports and (4) tracking reports.
All 10 regions and headquarters use FTTS but the FTTS regional databases work independently of one another. Regional FTTS data entry personnel send their data to headquarters every month to rebuild the National Compliance Data Base (NCDB).
Excludes: The NCDB scheduled as EPA 0420.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
FTTS acts as a local activity tracking and management tool. Each FTTS system is a stand-alone system for each regional office and is capable of functioning as a reporting tool. FTTS interacts with the NCDB to provide support for the national pesticides and toxics program.
Input data for FTTS is extracted from a variety of documents such as inspection reports import reviews samples etc. In addition all of the data contained in FTTS is not transferred to NCDB. For example selected data such as dates and comments are not included in the monthly update to NCDB. NCDB is scheduled as EPA 0420.
Specific legal citations include but are not limited to:

 Revised title of disposition item e.
Initially this system was submitted as part of EPA 0267 - FIFRATSCA Tracking SystemNational Compliance Data Base (FTTSNCDB). During the appraisal review held on August 8 2000 it was determined that the two systems should be scheduled separately with the data for FTTS as disposable. The retention meets program needs.
