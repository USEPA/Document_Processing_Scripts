Title: National Contaminant Occurrence Database (NCOD)
Program: Water
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-08-2
Description:
The National Contaminant Occurrence Database (NCOD) includes data used to identify contaminants on the Candidates Contaminant List (CCL). The data is used to determine whether to develop drinking water standards for a particular contaminant and to develop standards for the contaminants that the Agency selects. The information comes from a number of sources including public water systems and source (ambient) water data. For public systems the database holds historical data on regulated and unregulated contaminants. The data is available to the public.
The Safe Drinking Water Accession and Review System (SDWARS) serves as the input to NCOD and is scheduled as EPA 0253.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
See EPA 0253 for SDWARS. Records related to the development of regulations standards and guidelines and dockets are covered by schedule 1023.
