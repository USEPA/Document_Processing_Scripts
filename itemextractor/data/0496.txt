EPA Records Schedule 0496
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Air Quality System (AQS)
Program: Air
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-08-12
Description:
The Air Quality System (AQS) serves as the national repository for ambient air quality measurements and descriptive information about the locations where the ambient air quality data are collected. The data which is collected by state local and tribal agencies is periodically uploaded into AQS. It is used to track progress in implementing the national air pollution control program. For example EPA uses the data to determine non-attainment areas for pollutants that have national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for trends analysis modeling providing the public with information about the cleanliness of the air in various areas and for various air quality reports for Congress and others.
Users submit data via the EPA Central Data Exchange (CDX) on an as-needed basis and the data is transferred from AQS to the Envirofacts information warehouse.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
The Central Data Exchange is covered by schedule 0097. See schedule 0098 for Envirofacts.
Reasons for Disposition:
The following changes were made in the 04302008 version:
 Revised disposition instructions for item b.
 Added applicability to disposition items a c and e.
 Revised title of disposition item e.
This system was previously approved as the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) N1-412-99-8 and consisted of four databases: Air Quality System (AQS) Air Facility System (AFS) Geo-Common (GCS) and a mapping utility called AIRS graphic (AG). Three of the four systems have been phased out. The emissions portion of AFS was phased out in 2000 and new submissions are submitted to the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) scheduled as EPA 0002. The data from the Precision and Accuracy Reporting System (PARS) approved as NC1-412-81-1233 was transferred to AIRS in 1992. The compliance data is now managed by the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) and will be scheduled separately.
