Description:
The Chemical Information System (CIS) is a centralized data system that captures documents submitted under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as amended and documents decisions associated with the review and acceptance or rejection of those submissions. Information is entered into the system by: (1) industries using electronic reporting tools (2) EPA Confidential Business Information Center (CBIC) contractors who capture information from paper submissions (3) members of the Records and Docket Management Branch (RDMB) who participate in the prescreening acceptance or rejection of the submissions and (4) scientists within the program office who participate in the prescreening and review of submissions.
The system is Oracle based and has a Documentum repository. It contains a search tool that allows users to search on a wide variety of items such as submission types date ranges chemical IDs and company names. The system was activated in 2013 and the fielded data contained within the system dates back to the 1970s. The system contains both confidential business information (CBI) and non-CBI information.
