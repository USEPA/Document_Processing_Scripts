EPA Records Schedule 0063
Status: Final 06302019
Title: Electronic Models and Expert Systems
Program: All Programs
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 316 - Applied Research and Science Support
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-94-212
Description:
Includes a broad range of PC-based computer models and expert systems used in the evaluation scoring or interpretation of information or data in support of the Agencys mission. Some systems are designed for use by the public State programs or others outside EPA as well as EPA staff. Models allow user to enter data concerning a specific event case site chemical pesticide or other entity and conduct analysis or evaluation or develop estimates. Expert systems are used to guide users through a process and assist them in reaching a decision complete an application or other process. There are no legal requirements to create or maintain these systems.
Disposition Instructions:
Item a: (Reserved)
Item b: (Reserved)
Item c: Electronic data
NARA Disposal Authority: N1-412-94-212c

 Keep individual records for at least 2 years after completion of action and then delete when no longer needed.
Item d: (Reserved)
Item e: (Reserved)
Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
System users should be sure to document results of analyses completely. Complete documentation may require results input data used search parameters software used or similar information to ensure a complete record suitable for litigation support if necessary is maintained.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. NARA regulations require the electronic records be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and meet NARA-approved disposition. The electronic software program is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Input - Input for the system is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Output and reports - For disposition of output and reports refer to the records schedule for the activity supported by the output and reports. Follow the disposition instructions for the applicable records schedule item. If more than one records schedule or item applies follow the disposition instructions with the later dates.
System documentation - System documentation including system development documentation is covered by EPA 1012 item e.
