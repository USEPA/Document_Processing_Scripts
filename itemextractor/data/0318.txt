Status: Final 07312014
Title: Bulletins Live
Program: Pesticides
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-09-6
Description:
Bulletins Live is a system that helps users determine if limitations on pesticide use are necessary to ensure a pesticides use will not harm a species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. It functions as a portal through which the following types of data are available: state and county maps Endangered Species Protection Bulletins species protection demarcations and explanations and pesticide limitation codes. Based on user-entered criteria and maps bulletins are generated to show under what conditions a pesticide may be applied. Bulletins identify species of concern and the name of the pesticide active ingredient that may affect the species. They also provide a description of the protection measures necessary to protect the species and contain a county-level map showing the geographic area(s) associated with the protection measures depending on the susceptibility of the species to other factors such as vandalism. Bulletins are effective and enforceable as part of the pesticide product label.
The Bulletins Live system replaces the Endangered Species Map File. The Endangered Species Map File contains 8-12 x 11 inch endangered species habitat maps submitted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and states. Map information was used to produce digitized maps of habitat information. Maps were updated constantly until issued as an enforceable bulletin in the Federal Register. The file includes correspondence draft and final maps and supporting information from states the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
