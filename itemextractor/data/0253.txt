EPA Records Schedule 0253
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Safe Drinking Water Accession and Review System (SDWARS)
Program: Water
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-08-1
Description:
The Safe Drinking Water Accession and Review System (SDWARS) is a Web-based data entry system supporting the collection of data under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). The database allows all stakeholders to submit review and post data. Laboratories post UCMR data and the public water systems (PWSs) review approve and submit the posted results to EPA. The data is later transferred to the National Contaminant Occurrence Database (NCOD) to facilitate analysis review of contaminant occurrence and to guide the development of subsequent contaminants for the Candidates Contaminant List (CCL). The data in SDWARS is modified every five years to allow reporting of new unregulated contaminants.
SDWARS can also be used to maintain unregulated contaminant data generated from studies (e.g. sulfate in drinking water) or national surveys to determine whether or not to regulate a contaminant.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
The Safe Drinking Water Act was amended in 1996 requiring EPA to establish criteria to monitor unregulated contaminants and to identify a maximum of 30 contaminants to monitor every five years. The UCMR program coordinates with the CCL and the NCOD.
See EPA 0436 for NCOD. Records related to the development of regulations standards and guidelines and dockets are covered by schedule 1023.
Legal citations include but are not limited to:
 Safe Drinking Water Act as amended Section 1445(a)(2)
 40 CFR 141.24-141.40
Reasons for Disposition:
The following changes were made in the 04302008 version after NARA determined the records do not need to be permanent:
 Changed items c(1) and f to disposable and revised the disposition instructions.
 Deleted item c(2).
The following changes were made in the 03312008 version:
 Added file closure instructions and revised the disposition instructions for items a b and f.
 Divided item c into two subitems c(1) and c(2).
The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the collection of this data and historical data is needed to evaluate the impact of the regulation. The NCOD is scheduled as EPA 0436.
Item g for electronic copies created with word processing and electronic mail applications was deleted 08142006 pursuant to NARA Bulletin 2006-04.
