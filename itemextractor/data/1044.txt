Guidance:
Media neutral  This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information  When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Copies of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives - The copy of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives (previously scheduled as EPA 0133a(1)(c) 0134a(1)(c) 0134a(2)(c) 0134a(3)(c) 0206a(3) 0207c(3) 0237a(3) 0399a(3) 0412a(3) 0412c(3) 0412d(3) 0508a(2)(c) 0509a(3) 0686b(2)(c) 0688b(3) 0689a(3) 0689b(3) 0690b(3) 0693b(3) maintained by the submitting office until they are notified by NARA that the transfer is successful is a nonrecord (EPA 0008 item a) and can be deleted when no longer needed.
Delegated programs  If a state or other entity is authorized to implement a program and the delegated entity maintains the records for the period identified above or longer the EPA regional office may destroy the copies it receives when no longer needed. If recordkeeping requirements (e.g. what records to keep and how long to keep them) for authorized entities are not covered in EPAs regulations the requirements should be established in a memorandum of understanding.
Disposition
 The record copy of NEPA-related records formerly covered by schedules 134 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Preparation Files and 135 309 Review and Comment Files are maintained by OFA at headquarters. Copies maintained by other offices may be destroyed after submission to OFA.
 Landmark cases - Landmark cases are historic exceptional cases of major lasting interest at the national or regional level as well as cases of major precedential significance affecting the legal responsibilities of one or more industrial or commercial sectors across the country. Landmark cases typically involve substantial sustained interest on the part of the public and the media as well as significant interest on the part of elected officials.
 Civil enforcement action files maintained in EPA regional offices  The regional unit with enforcement authority is responsible for maintaining the record copy and implementing the disposition including selecting landmark cases for recommendation to the Regional Administrator or the Regional Administrators designee. Criminal investigation files  Criminal investigation files are maintained by the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurances (OECAs) Criminal Investigation Division. Attorney files pertaining to criminal enforcement matters are held by the assigned attorneys office (Region or Headquarters). Selecting historically significant (landmark) criminal case files for recommendation to the OECA Assistant Administrator is the responsibility of the Director of the Criminal Investigation Division Office of Criminal Enforcement Forensics and Training.
 Copies of these records incorporated into other files (e.g. site or facility files) are to be retained according to the disposition instructions for the records they support.
 In situations where one file (e.g. facility file) contains records covered by more than one records schedule retain the records for the longest retention period.
 UIC well monitoring reports - UIC Class II III and V wells are regulated under solution mining and other permits including deep and shallow injection wells pose no threat to human health or the environment. The monitoring reports maintained in the regional offices are used as compliance documents similar to other enforcement programs and are covered by item d.
Field activities
 The EPA QA Field Activities Procedure (CIO 2105-P-02.0) applies to both sampling and non-sampling field activities and provides records management requirements for field activities including field notebooks. To the extent possible legacy field notebooks should be reviewed and activities identified to be consistent with the Procedure and local applicable standard operating procedures.
 EPAs Policy on the Use of Mobile Field Inspection Tools (https:www.epa.govcompliancepolicy-use-mobile-field-inspection-tools) establishes the use of electronic devices to access create use analyze and collect information as part of inspections field investigations or compliance evaluations. When using electronic devices it is very important to demonstrate that there has been no change to the original files and any edits made to the files must be tracked and retained according to the requirements of this records schedule as stated in section d (Preservation of Records) of the Policy.
File closures
 Compliance files - Close files upon completion of review and determination that no additional investigation is warranted and no enforcement is to be pursued.
 Inspector credentials - Close files when the credential expires.
 Regional administrative and civil or criminal judicial enforcement actions - Enforcement action files maintained in program offices and by case attorneys may be transferred to the federal records center (FRC) upon settlement of the case (issued consent agreementsfinal orders (CAFOs) issued administrative orders on consent (AOCs) or entered consent decrees or similar judicial settlement documents e.g. Judgments). Compliance and monitoring activities required by the settlement document are considered part of the enforcement action file. Program offices and case attorneys should establish a procedure for determining when the file is to be closed and transferred to the FRC so both sets of records have a consistent disposition. For example: The program office notifies the Office of Regional Counsel (ORC) when the compliance activities for an enforcement action are complete and the case attorney certifies the case is closed or the consent decree is terminated and the final close date. The program office updates the disposition date for records at the FRC if needed.
Related records - Permits are covered by schedule 1047.
