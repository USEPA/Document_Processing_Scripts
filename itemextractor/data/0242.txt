Description:
The Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) is a national air monitoring network sponsored by EPA and the National Park Service (NPS). The network collects data from over 80 monitoring sites across the United States for determining relationships between emissions air quality deposition and ecological effects. The National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN) EPAs forerunner to CASTNET was established in 1986 to provide information on and to track trends in pollutant concentrations and the dry deposition component of total atmospheric deposition. CASTNET was established in 1991 and NDDN was merged into CASTNET. Public data is available on EPAs Web site.

If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
