EPA Records Schedule 0096
Status: Final 12312014
Title: Data Standards and Registry Services
Program: All Programs
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 404 - Technology Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-08-15
Description:
Registries provide the ability to register map and manage metadata and information important to the Agency and its partner systems. Registries may contain objects or data used within multiple systems such as common code sets facility information or substances. They may contain information about individual Agency systems or datasets or reusable software components and services that may be used in multiple systems. Registration of contents is the single unique concept that makes a registry a registry. Quality assurance is provided and stewards are assigned to maintain and manage specific contents. In all cases registries serve as an organizing structure for the purpose of facilitating discovery of Agency information resources. The registries do not contain environmental data but are collections or repositories of metadata that describe information to make the data more meaningful and easier to find.
Data standards are part of the EPA Enterprise Data Architecture. They are maintained with the EPA registries. Data standards are used to improve the quality of environmental data and also facilitate data integration.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20.
