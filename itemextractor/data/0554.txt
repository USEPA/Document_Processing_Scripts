Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 403 - Human Resources Management
NARA Disposal Authority:

Disposition Instructions:
Item a: Record copy
NARA Disposal Authority: N1-412-07-623a
 Disposable
 Close inactive records upon transfer or separation.
 Destroy 2 years after file closure.
Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
This item is to be applied by personnel offices. Other official personnel folders (OPFs) are scheduled as EPA 0553.
Reasons for Disposition:
The disposition instructions have been rewritten as media neutral to allow for maintaining the record copy in EPAs electronic recordkeeping system. The retention has not changed.
