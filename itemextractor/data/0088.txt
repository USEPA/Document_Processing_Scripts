Description:
Includes a broad range of primarily PC-based systems used to provide ready user friendly access to frequently used information. Information may be drawn from other Agency databases commercially available databases Agency records publicly available sources or a combination of sources. Also includes metadata repositories.
Information is brought together to simplify access and provide specialized support for specific information needs. In no case is the system (a) required by law (b) necessary to administer a program or (c) necessary to document program activity. If the information in the system is used for any of the activities a - c above an information system (automated or manual) is maintained separately to satisfy those requirements. If the system is used as a finding aid to records it is disposable under either an Agency approved schedule or NARAs General Records Schedules (GRS).
Disposition Instructions:
Item a: (Reserved)
Item b: (Reserved)
Item c: Electronic data
NARA Disposal Authority: N1-412-94-215c
 Disposable
 Delete individual records 2 years after completion of action and when no longer needed.
Item d: (Reserved)
Item e: (Reserved)
Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program formerly item a is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. NARA regulations require that electronic records be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and meet NARA-approved disposition. The electronic software program is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Input - Input formerly item b is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Output and reports - For disposition of output and reports formerly item d refer to the records schedule for the activity supported by the output and reports. Follow the disposition instructions for the applicable records schedule item. If more than one records schedule or item applies follow the disposition instructions with the later dates.
System documentation - System documentation including system development documentation formerly item e is covered by schedule 1012 item e.

This schedule also covers metadata repositories including locational metadata (e.g. latitude and longitude) used for geographic information systems (GIS). The systems that use the locational metadata and GIS functionality to support monitoring and assessment activities are covered by other schedules (e.g. EPA 0063).
Electronic information systems with long-term or permanent retention such as the Air Quality System (AQS) (EPA 0496) are scheduled separately. Other disposable systems not requiring specific schedules have been categorized into this schedule or one of the other generic or big bucket schedules:
 EPA 0062 - Laboratory Information Management Systems
 EPA 0063 - Electronic Models and Expert Systems
 EPA 0089 - Information Tracking Systems
 EPA 0090 - Administrative Support Databases
 EPA 0094 - Electronic Bulletin Boards
 EPA 0096 - Data Standards and Registry Services
 EPA 0098 - Data Marts and Data Warehouses
Electronic records not requiring their own schedules or covered in one of the big bucket schedules above may be segments or phases of information systems covered by schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management.
