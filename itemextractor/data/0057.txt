EPA Records Schedule 0057
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Environmental Review Tracking System (ERPERTS)
Program: Federal Activities
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-94-29
Description:
The Environmental Review Tracking System is a central data repository for Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The system data initially extracted from the EIS tracks such information as the title of the EIS date filed and date review comments are due back to the Agency. The Council on Environmental Quality requires the Agency to maintain the system and publish weekly a notice of available EISs in the Federal Register. Under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act EPA is required to review all EISs and other designated Federal actions and to publish in the Federal Register any project determined to be environmentally unsatisfactory. The system is a relatively simple data entry and retrieval application.

Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
