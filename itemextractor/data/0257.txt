EPA Records Schedule 0257
Status: Final 01312016
Title: National RCRA Information System (RCRAInfo)
Program: RCRA
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-04-8
Description:
RCRAInfo is one of EPAs mission-critical systems used by EPA regional offices and the states to record and track information provided by the regulated community concerning the generation shipment treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. Input includes information from facilities on the amounts and kinds of hazardous waste being generated transported and stored during the reporting year.
In most cases the states serve as primary implementers of the program in lieu of EPA regional offices. However in some states and for certain aspects of the program EPA regions retain all or some program implementation responsibility. EPA headquarters regions and states work in partnership to redefine information needs for the RCRA program under the Waste Information Needs and the Information for Making Environmental Decisions initiative (WINInformed).
The system also tracks significant milestones of state and EPA activity supporting program planning implementation and reporting of accomplishments. Output also includes data for the National Biennial Report on Hazardous Waste that is prepared under Congressional mandate as well as ad hoc reports.
The system interfaces with other EPA systems including the Facility Registry System (FRS) and Envirofacts which are scheduled separately.

However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
