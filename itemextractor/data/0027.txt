NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-05-5
Description:
The Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) is the core information management system supporting the enforcement and compliance operations of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA). In addition ICIS has replaced several older legacy programmatic systems including the Permit Compliance System (PCS) which supported the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program and the Air Facility System (AFS) which supported the Clean Air Act (CAA) Stationary Source program. ICIS is used for tracking federal enforcement and compliance CAA and NPDES activities performed by the EPA headquarters regional offices states and local agency offices. Selected information in ICIS is made available to the public through the Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) system. It also includes information on Tribal lands where enforcement activities may occur.
Data in the system includes detailed facility information and compliance activities such as compliance monitoring compliance determination deficiencies incident descriptions and enforcement descriptions. Incident descriptions include required notifications and citizen tips or complaints enforcement actions and reports. Enforcement descriptions include case initiations settlement information benefits and follow-up activities resulting from the enforcement action. Additional information for the NPDES program includes: Permit data Effluent Limits and Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) data. Additional information for the CAA program includes: Stack Tests Title V Annual Compliance Certifications Compliance Monitoring Strategy status and Alleged Violation Files. The NPDES and CAA information is entered by state and local agencies as well as by EPA. Federal enforcement and compliance data is entered by EPA headquarters and regional office attorneys and engineers from paper legal documents the Case Conclusion Data Sheets and inspection reports. Much of the information from state and local agencies is submitted electronically from external systems using standardized formats via the Exchange Network and EPAs Central Data Exchange (CDX). ICIS also includes extensive reporting capabilities to extract and display the desired information. Some NPDES-regulated entities submit electronic data to ICIS via the EPA CDX on an as-needed basis according to their permit requirements.
Certain data within ICIS are made available to other EPA systems including the Facility Registry System (FRS) and ECHO which are scheduled separately.
