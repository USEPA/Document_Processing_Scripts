EPA Records Schedule 0754
Status: Final 12312013
Title: Underground Injection Control National Database (UIC DB)
Program: Water
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 DAA-0412-2013-0003-0001 (Item a)
 DAA-0412-2013-0003-0002 (Item b)
Description:
The UIC National Database (UIC DB) supports the EPA oversight and management of the Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs directly implemented by the EPA Regions State and tribal governments to regulate the owners and operators of underground injection wells (UIC) in order to prevent endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. EPA has awarded selected States with primary enforcement authority (primacy) to implement federal requirements and has assumed direct implementation authority (DI) for all State and Tribal programs without primacy.
The UIC DB initially deployed in 2007 is a relational database management system composed of UIC facility and well inventory permit inspection violation and enforcement data. The UIC DB flows data from the 69 UIC programs (57 states 2 Tribal and 10 Regional DI). The source data received from the primacy states and Regional DI programs are submitted through the Central Data Exchange (CDX) validated and then parsed and loaded into the preproduction version of the UIC DB. Once reviewed and accepted by EPA the preproduction version is imported into the production version of the UIC DB. Submitted data replace the previous data files on a quarterly basis. The UIC data in the production version of the UIC DB will be used to support the Agencys response to any queries including from the public. Both versions of the UIC DB are on an Oracle application server at the National Computer Center (NCC). This database is maintained by the headquarters Office of Water.
Disposition Instructions:
Item a: Electronic data
NARA Disposal Authority: DAA-0412-2013-0003-0001
 Permanent
 Close when program is discontinued or system is terminated.
 When system is in operation transfer a copy of the data from the production version of the UIC DB every 5 years to the National Archives as specified in 36 CFR 1235.44-1235.50 or standards applicable at the time. Transfer final data to the National Archives 6 months after system is closed.
Item b: Input
Includes input from primacy states and Regional DI programs.
NARA Disposal Authority: DAA-0412-2013-0003-0002
 Disposable
 Close when data have been entered into the master file or database and verified or when no longer required to support reconstruction of or serve as backup to a master file or database whichever is later.
 Destroy immediately after file closure.
Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Until a primacy state or regional DI program transitions to the UIC database as its data of record all official UIC reporting to EPA from a primacy state and regional DI program continues to be done at a summary level through the 7520s or the Performance Accountable Measures. Full implementation of the UIC National Database for all UIC programs is projected to be 2013. The regional DI databases will continue in operation after its other reporting transitions to use of the UIC database.
EPA regional offices maintain separate databases for the State and Tribal programs they directly implement containing detailed information on wells including well operators ownership nature and type of wells operating status and permits. Implementation varies from region to region. Some information from these regional systems is extracted and sent to EPA headquarters for the UIC Program Summary System. Regional systems may include additional fields not reported in the UIC DB but deemed to be important by the offices. In the EPA regional office in Chicago for example a tribal code is entered to designate which reservation the well is located within.
UIC permits are covered by schedule 1047. See schedule 1044 for enforcement action and compliance files. The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program Summary System maintained by headquarters is covered by EPA 0432.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. NARA regulations require that electronic records be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and meet NARA-approved disposition. The electronic software program is covered by schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management.
Output and reports - For disposition of output and reports refer to the records schedule for the activity supported by the output and reports. Follow the disposition instructions for the applicable records schedule item. If more than one records schedule or item applies follow the disposition instructions with the later dates.
System documentation - System documentation consisting of those records necessary to document how the system captures manipulates and outputs data while in operation at EPA is covered by schedule 1012.
System development documentation - System development documentation including but not limited to implementation plans flow status milestones target completion dates and business rules for data validation is maintained in EPAs Central Data Exchange (CDX) and covered by EPA 0097 item c.

The UIC National Database was developed in response to a growing need for consistent well related information for use in decision making regulatory activities and reporting to Congress. The data in the regional databases was previously approved as permanent (N1-412-06-31).
