Program: All Programs
Applicability: Headquarters
Function: 404 - Technology Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-07-37
Description:
The Correspondence Management System (CMS) is an electronic document management system that captures stores routes and tracks correspondence responses and supporting documents. The system is available for use Agency-wide. Documents are either scanned or keyed into the system and routed through the review and approval process. The system has predefined templates for responses and can import documents from other databases. After signature the final signed document is scanned into the system.
All data from the predecessor system National Correspondence Tracking and Information Management System (NCTIMS) was migrated to CMS in October 2004.
Disposition Instructions:
Item a: (Reserved)
Item b: (Reserved)

Item e: (Reserved)
Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in electronic format only and is not media neutral. The electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
CMS is not a recordkeeping system. However since it interfaces with EPAs electronic recordkeeping system (ECMS) retention is managed via ECMS and paper copies may be destroyed after they have been placed into CMS and checked for quality. Records placed into CMS and ECMS are covered by their specific records schedules and not this schedule. For example controlled correspondence for senior officials is covered by schedule 1051 and controlled correspondence for employees other than senior officials and general correspondence is covered by schedule 1006.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program formerly item a is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period. The electronic software program is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Input - Input formerly item b is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Output and reports - For disposition of output and reports formerly item d refer to the records schedule for the activity supported by the output and reports. Follow the disposition instructions for the applicable records schedule item. If more than one records schedule or item applies follow the disposition instructions with the later dates.
System documentation - System documentation including system development documentation formerly item e refers to those records necessary to document how the system captures manipulates and outputs data. Disposition of system documentation is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
