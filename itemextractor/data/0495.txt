EPA Records Schedule 0495
Status: Final 02282017
Title: RadNet
Program: Radiation
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-99-7
Description:
RadNet formerly known as the Environmental Radiation Ambient Monitoring System (ERAMS) is a national system of monitoring stations that regularly collect air precipitation and drinking water to track radiation in the environment. Over time RadNet sample testing and monitoring results show the fluctuations in normal background levels of environmental radiation. The RadNet system will also detect higher than normal background levels of environmental radiation and higher than normal radiation levels during a radiological incident.
RadNet has more than 135 stationary air monitors located across all 50 states. RadNet also has 40 deployable air monitors that can be sent anywhere in the United States if needed. RadNet stationary monitors run 24 hours a day 7 days a week and send near-real-time measurements of gamma radiation to EPAs National Analytical Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL). Computers continuously review these data. If there is a meaningful increase in radiation levels laboratory staff are alerted and then investigate the cause.
RadNet data are available in databases and reports. EPA releases analytical and monitoring results after checking to ensure they meet quality standards. Envirofacts RadNet Database contains laboratory analysis results from air monitor filters and samples of precipitation and drinking water. Historical RadNet milk sampling data is available in the Envirofacts RadNet database as well. This database includes both the current and historical data needed to estimate long-term trends in environmental radiation levels. The RadNet Database in EPAs Central Data Exchange (CDX) contains the near-real-time environmental data from fixed and deployable air monitors. Environmental Radiation Data (ERD) is an electronic (and formerly print) journal published quarterly by NAREL in Montgomery Alabama. It contains data from RadNet and its predecessor systems.

The electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Electronic software program - The electronic software program formerly item a is to be kept as long as needed to ensure access to and use of the electronic records throughout the authorized retention period to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. NARA regulations require that electronic records be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition and is covered by schedule 1012 item c.
Input - Input formerly item b is covered by schedule 1012 item e.
Output and reports - For disposition of output and reports formerly item d refer to the records schedule for the activity supported by the output and reports. Follow the disposition instructions for the applicable records schedule item. If more than one records schedule or item applies follow the disposition instructions with the later dates.
System documentation - System documentation including system development documentation formerly item e refers to those records necessary to document how the system captures manipulates and outputs data. System documentation is transferred to the National Archives along with the electronic data. Disposition of system documentation is covered by schedule 1012 item a.
Related records schedules - Published data from this system is covered by schedule 1022 item a. Envirofacts is covered by schedule 0098 and CDX is covered by schedule 0097.
