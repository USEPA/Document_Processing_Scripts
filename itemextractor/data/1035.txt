Guidance:
Media neutral - This schedule authorizes the disposition of the record copy in any media (media neutral). However if the format (e.g. electronic) of permanent records is specified in a records schedule approved by NARA the records are to be transferred to the National Archives in accordance with NARA standards at the time of transfer. If the record copy is created in electronic format or digitized (e.g. imaged) and maintained electronically (e.g. Data on Aquatic Resources Tracking for Effective Regulation (DARTER) maintained in the Office of Water) the electronic records must be retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct Agency business and to meet NARA-approved disposition to comply with 36 CFR Sections 1236.10 1236.12 1236.14 and 1236.20. Retention and disposition requirements for the various components of electronic systems (e.g. software input output system documentation) are covered in schedule 1012 Information and Technology Management. In addition to 36 CFR 1236 see Basic Requirements of an Electronic Recordkeeping System at EPA on the EPA records intranet site [http:intranet.epa.govrecordstoolserks.html].
Sensitive information - When records are due for destruction according to the disposition instructions records containing sensitive information (e.g. confidential business information (CBI) personally identifiable information (PII)) must be shredded or otherwise definitively destroyed to protect confidentiality.
Related records - Site-specific records for Superfund Brownfields and oil spills are covered by schedule 1036. Contracts are covered by schedule 1004 and grants and other program agreements by schedule 1003. Compliance and enforcement records are covered by schedule 1044 and permits by schedule 1047.
Permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives - The copy of permanent electronic records transferred to the National Archives (e.g. previously scheduled as EPA 0091a(3) EPA 0213a(3) EPA 0233a(3) EPA 0247a(3) EPA 0258a(3) EPA 0261a(3) EPA 0262a(3) EPA 0314a(3) EPA 0315c(1)(c) EPA 0324a(3) EPA 0326a(3) EPA 0335a(3) EPA 0348a(3) EPA 0361a(3) EPA 0364a(3) EPA 0371a(3) EPA 0372a(3) EPA 0414a(3) EPA 0449a(1)(c) EPA 0451a(3) EPA 0452a(3) EPA 0453a(3) EPA 0454a(3) EPA 0455a(3) EPA 0460a(3) EPA 0461b(3) EPA 0472a(3) EPA 0501a(3) EPA 0507a(3) EPA 0507b(3) EPA 0507c(3) EPA 0514a(3) EPA 0741a(3)) maintained by the submitting office until they are notified by NARA that the transfer is successful is a nonrecord (EPA 0008 item a) and can be deleted when no longer needed.
Cited sources  Copies of published material cited in a report study or similar records do not need to be included as part of the official records if they are publicly available. If the cited material is available on a website the citation must include the specific website address (e.g. http:www.epa.gov...) and the date the material was accessed. If however the website material is critical to support the decision conclusion recommendation or guidance provided in the record the material must be filed in the recordkeeping system with the record if possible.
Delegated programs  If a state or other entity is authorized to implement a program and the delegated entity maintains the records for the period identified above or longer the EPA regional program office may destroy the copies it receives when no longer needed. If recordkeeping requirements (e.g. what records to keep and how long to keep them) for authorized entities are not covered in EPAs regulations the requirements should be established in a memorandum of understanding.
Quality assurance records  Quality assurance records for specific projects or research files are to be maintained according to the same disposition instructions as the records they support. Item c covers quality assurance project plans (QAPPs) and quality management plans (QMPs) maintained as a separate collection. Unacceptable draft versions of approved QAPPs and QMPs may be destroyed when no longer needed.
Disaster response records  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq. authorizes the President to issue major disaster and emergency declarations. The Agency Records Officer will notify offices if the records are to be maintained as permanent records under item a and will provide additional recordkeeping guidance. Superfund National Priority List (NPL) files for sites affected by a natural catastrophe or emergency should continue to be documented in the appropriate site file covered by schedule 1036.
Original (raw) data and workpapers related to EPAs scientific research that are used to form the basis for the research conclusions must be retained for the approved retention period for the related research project files to ensure the integrity and defensibility of the research records.
Tissue samples and specimens  Tissue samples and specimens including wet specimens samples of test control or reference substances and specially prepared material that are relatively fragile and differ markedly in stability and quality during storage are to be retained only as long as the quality of the preparation affords evaluation. Specimens obtained from mutagenicity tests specimens of soil water and plants and wet specimens of blood urine feces biological fluids do not need to be retained after quality assurance verification. In some research studies involving humans the agreement with the human subjects requires samples to be destroyed immediately after the analysis and quality assurance verification is complete. In that case the sample is retained as specified in the agreement. Other tissue samples and specimens are to be retained according to the disposition instructions for item d.
Final manuscripts of articles and other publications are permanent records and covered by item a of schedule 1022. Copies of manuscripts and other publications may be maintained in the related project file and are maintained according to the same disposition instructions as the records they support.
TSCA administrative and tracking control records maintained with the related case files are subject to the same retention as the related files.
