Description:
The Chemical Update System (CUS) contains confidential data reported by industry (approximately 1200 companies) as a partial update of the TSCA Inventory. Manufacturers and importers are required to report company information (plant site name address DUNS number) and chemical information (CAS registry number PMNBonafideTMEA or CCID Number and production volume) for chemicals they manufactured or imported in excess of 10000 pounds in the immediately preceding fiscal year. Polymers naturally occurring substances and UVCBs are exempt from reporting requirements. Reporting takes place every four years beginning in December 1986. Production volumes on the CUS database are discrete amounts rather than ranges found on the Chemicals in Commerce Information System (CICIS).
