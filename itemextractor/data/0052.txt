Description:
SCORPIOS (Superfund Cost Recovery Package Imaging and On-Line System) was formerly known as STARS (Superfund Transaction Automated Retrieval System) and SCRIPS (Superfund Cost Recovery Image Processing System). Through the use of image processing technology SCORPIOS facilitates the storage and retrieval of all site-specific Superfund cost documentation. Input records include timesheets travel vouchers miscellaneous expenditures contract invoices IAG payments and other supporting cost documentation. This application is used to generate the financial documentation for the cost recovery package.
SCORPIOS captures financial documentation images at Regional and field sites (i.e. Washington Cincinnati RTP) throughout the country. Initially all those images were stored centrally at EPAs National Computer Center (NCC) data processing facility. The system has been decentralized into each of the Regions.
