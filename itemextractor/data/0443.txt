Title: Hazardous Waste Injection Well Database
Program: Water
Applicability: Agency-wide
Function: 108 - Environmental Management
NARA Disposal Authority:
 N1-412-95-45
Description:
The Hazardous Waste Injection Well Database is a PC-based inventory of Class I wells as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The system stores information obtained during a special study to collect information for the 1985 Report to Congress on Injection of Hazardous Wastes. It also provides information on alternative treatment capacity analysis in addition to scheduling which wells are affected by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
The database includes the following data: facility or well owneroperator identification and well class codes chemical information concerning the injectate well construction information hydrogeological information about the area where injection occurs waste information RCRA codes and volumes.
The database consists of well records of active inactive and abandoned Class I wells and some limited information on Class I nonhazardous and Class IV wells. Since the completion of the study few states have elected to update their information therefore the major portion of records are only up-to-date as of 1987.
