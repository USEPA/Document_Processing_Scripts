Draft Permit Basic Information Technical Specification
Hi
Alison
Please find
attached the draft of the ICIS Batch Permit
Basic Information Technical Specification.
To open the file
please change the extension from .zap
to .zip.
Note that the document references
Attachment 1: Contacts and
Addresses because permits have contact and address
data.
That is the same Attachment 1 that was recently delivered
as a Final
document as part of the Permitted Features technical specification
deliverable.
There have been no
changes to anything in that attachment
since it was delivered as Final so I have not re-attached it to this email in
an
effort to avoid confusion.
However if you would like me to re-send
that attachment for your reference just let me
know.
I have also attached the Deliverable Performance
Checklist which covers both the draft Permit Basic Information
Technical
Specification and the draft Unpermitted Facility technical specification.
Please return a signed copy of the
checklist upon receipt.
(The draft
Unpermitted Facility Technical Specification is being delivered in a separate
email
momentarily).
Please
review this document and provide
comments by September 24 2009.
Let me know if you have any
questions.
Thanks
Abby
