Randy
Where would you like me to send the Trimble? Hilary would be my recommendation since I should be able to put it in an
official EPA Pouch. I think the last run for today has been sent out but it would go out first thing in the morning. What
would you prefer?
Rome

Hi Randy and Rome
I think it is best to send it to Jeff Barrett (a NEIWPCC employee) or Hilary Snook (EPA lakes coordinator
in NE)....I will only be in the lab Tuesday and then off for two days to RI for beaches study and OSV Bold
tour guide duties...
